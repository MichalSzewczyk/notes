# Managing people
Main tasks for managing people:
* taking on a new report
* Holding regular 1-2-1s
* Giving feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, fields for improvement, reward for achievements


## New report
Build trust and rapport
Create 30/60/90 plan - Define the goals for a new hire that will help you to asses if this is the right hire or not. Define clear, measurable and achievable milestones for 30, 60 and 90 days.
Establish the "New Joiner Guide" documentation where new hires will contribute.
Communicate style and expectations.
Get feedback from your new hire - it is important to get the feedback to make sure a new hire is satisfied, but also first 90 days after joining is a rare period when new hire can see the things that are not visible to the non-new hires.
Scheduling regular 1-2-1s is crucial regardless if all seems to be working fine or not.
Adjust 1-2-1s progressively following hire's needs.
Prepare the to-do list for the meetings. It may be worth to keep it shared with your report so that you can both see what will be discussed and therefore be better prepared.

## Rules
Thread the information sharing, good or bad in positive to neutral way
Create the culture of continuous feedback:
* know your people
* observe your people
* Provide lightweight, regular feedback
* Provide coaching

## People drama
* you have to nip drama people in the bud
* a brilliant jerk is the most difficult type of drama people to handle, but usually the cost of keeping such person
in the team is much higher than benefit from his productivity
* negative person is easier to deal with, usually requires corrective feedback

## Unhappiness due to overwork
* manager has to be with the team and contribute while there is tough time in the project
* team has to be frequently re-assured it does the great job
* manager has to do whatever is in his power to avoid team's overwork in the future

## Collaboration problems between various teams
* listed to the feedback and organize the meeting to have a productive conversation on identifying improvements
* organize team building meeting and socialize

## Act as a shield
* Manager has to shield the team from irrelevant aspects that could distract it from the key goals
* Shield the team is a wise way, so that the team also understands what's going on around and proactively inform 
team about possible news that otherwise would come to them as a gossip

## 
* Create data-driven culture, create the meaningful metrics that will help to understand the gaps and measure the 
progress in gap resolution
* Understand who is your business and understand business needs
* Understand the project roadmap and plan the technical roadmap reflecting the business needs
* Frequently review the outcome of the decisions you have made to learn from them

## Ways to manage the conflict
* Don't relay on a consensus or voting too heavily, due to various backgrounds and skill sets majority may not always
make the best judgement call on given subject
* Depersonalize decisions and make sure to establish decision-making process that will work that way
* Do not turn a blind eye on simmering issues - negative feedback during performance review should not come as a surprise
* Do address issues without courting drama
* Be kind to your directs and peers

## Behavioural anti patterns
* Brilliant jerk - a pearson who is technically excellent but kills team spirit, it's hard to deal with such pearson
as it's difficult to justify letting go someone that delivers a lot. Usually it's enough to just not promote them and
they will quit by themselves.
* Noncommunicator - a pearson who hides information from others. There may be various reasons for his behaviour, frequent
ones are:
  - Person is afraid of critism - asses whether the team has a culture promoting trust and growth
  - Person is too self-confident so that he thinks he knows best - it may require corrective feedback
* Employee who lacks respect you or the rest of the team - best is to help the person leave the company
