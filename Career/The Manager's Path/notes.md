# Managing people
Main tasks for managing people:
* taking on a new report
* Holding regular 1-2-1s
* Giving feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, fields for improvement, reward for achievements


## New report
Build trust and rapport
Create 30/60/90 plan - Define the goals for a new hire that will help you to asses if this is the right hire or not. Define clear, measurable and achievable milestones for 30, 60 and 90 days.
Establish the "New Joiner Guide" documentation where new hires will contribute.
Communicate style and expectations.
Get feedback from your new hire - it is important to get the feedback to make sure a new hire is satisfied, but also first 90 days after joining is a rare period when new hire can see the things that are not visible to the non-new hires.
Scheduling regular 1-2-1s is crucial regardless if all seems to be working fine or not.
Adjust 1-2-1s progressively following hire's needs.
Prepare the to-do list for the meetings. It may be worth to keep it shared with your report so that you can both see what will be discussed and therefore be better prepared.

## Rules

Create the culture of continuous feedback:
* know your people
* observe your people
* Provide lightweight, regular feedback
* Provide coaching

## People drama
* you have to nip drama people in the bud
* a brilliant jerk is the most difficult type of drama people to handle, but usually the cost of keeping such person
in the team is much higher than benefit from his productivity
* negative person is easier to deal with, usually requires corrective feedback

## Unhappiness due to overwork
* manager has to be with the team and contribute while there is tough time in the project

* manager has to do whatever is in his power to avoid team's overwork in the future

## Collaboration problems between various teams
* listed to the feedback and organize the meeting to have a productive conversation on identifying improvements
* organize team building meeting and socialize

## Act as a shield
* Manager has to shield the team from irrelevant aspects that could distract it from the key goals
* Shield the team is a wise way, so that the team also understands what's going on around and proactively inform 
team about possible news that otherwise would come to them as a gossip

progress in gap resolution
