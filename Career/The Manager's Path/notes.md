# Managing people
Main tasks for managing people:
* taking on a new report
* Holding regular 1-2-1s
* Giving feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, fields for improvement, reward for achievements


## New report
Build trust and rapport
Create 30/60/90 plan - Define the goals for a new hire that will help you to asses if this is the right hire or not. Define clear, measurable and achievable milestones for 30, 60 and 90 days.
Establish the "New Joiner Guide" documentation where new hires will contribute.
Communicate style and expectations.
Get feedback from your new hire - it is important to get the feedback to make sure a new hire is satisfied, but also first 90 days after joining is a rare period when new hire can see the things that are not visible to the non-new hires.
Scheduling regular 1-2-1s is crucial regardless if all seems to be working fine or not.
Adjust 1-2-1s progressively following hire's needs.
Prepare the to-do list for the meetings. It may be worth to keep it shared with your report so that you can both see what will be discussed and therefore be better prepared.
